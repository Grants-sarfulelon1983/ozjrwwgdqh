Just out of Drop. Heads still spinning, like I was just dropped into another dimension or something?? haha. Movie was like this mad fever dream, you know? Can’t even tell if it was the sugar crash or all those flashing lights. Geez, that noise — could still hear it. Not the film, but the popcorn crunching, chair squeaking, that baby crying three rows back... An assault on the senses, honestly.

All I remember is this scene... there were pigeons everywhere, like they were plotting something—mischievous little beasts. Who came up with that? Director must've had pigeons for lunch or something. It’s surreal when they pecked at that red balloon... or was that a metaphor—who knows?? Kinda genius in a crazy way. Speaking of genius, did they mean to have the soundtrack feel like a garage band testing new instruments?

> Download the movie, someone said, but honestly the big screen makes it feel like an out-of-body thing, can’t replicate that at home. I was just there, vibing. Janice, wasnt this the movie you wanted me to watch? Yep, total trip. 

Oh, and that moment when the main guy (what was his name again? Sounds like every guy I've known) turns to the camera, speaks in German... but then it switches to Spanish or something. Couldn't keep up, text cutting between the lines like mixed tapes. There was an explosion, or maybe it's just me overeacting... nah, it definitely was an explosion. 

Clouds—a lot of clouds, man. Every time I looked at the screen, just clouds. I thought I had nodded off and reimagined a weather channel. It was like dreaming while awake, but with snacks. Wait, snacks... was there ever a scene without food?

> A guy bumped into me, all in the dark fumbling for his seat like it was musical chairs. It was funnier than the movie at times. Why do movie theaters feel like microwave ovens at full blast? Felt like popcorn kernel left behind, burning somewhere inside... kinda the point of that scene with the burning piano, probably. Oddly poetic.

Would I watch the movie again? Maybe if I find someone as confused as I am to rewatch it together. I think. Have to read between the lines or maybe between the popcorn seats, haha.

(function(confusion){
    if (confusion > 100){
        return brain overload;
    } else {
        let morePopcorn = true;
    }
}).bind('myMind');
